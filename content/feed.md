#title
Development of Facial Recognition Algorithms with OpenCV and Python
#description
We present a project that uses a Raspberry Pi to perform real-time face detection and recognition, and sends them to a server written in Django via the MQTT protocol. On the server, facial recognition models are trained with the OpenCV library and sent back to the Raspberry Pi. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of using low-cost, high-performance devices to implement facial recognition systems.
